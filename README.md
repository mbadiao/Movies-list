## About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly movie management application that allows users to maintain and explore a personalized movie collection. The application will enable users to add new movies to their collection, complete with details such as the movie title, description, poster URL, and rating. Additionally, users will be able to filter their collection based on the movie title or rating, making it easy to find specific movies or discover films within a certain rating range. This project aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience for movie enthusiasts who want to keep track of their favorite films and easily access information about them.
